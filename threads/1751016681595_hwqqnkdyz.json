      "content": "Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits which share the same significant position and value. It works by sorting numbers digit by digit, from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD) or vice versa.\n\nHere's how Radix Sort typically works (LSD Radix Sort):\n\n1.  **Determine the Maximum Number of Digits (d):** Find the number with the maximum digits in the input array. This determines how many passes the sorting algorithm will make.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Digits:** For each digit position (from the least significant to the most significant):\n    *   **Stable Sort (e.g., Counting Sort):** Use a stable sorting algorithm (like Counting Sort) to sort the numbers based on the current digit. A stable sort is crucial because it preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys.\n    *   **Distribution (Bucketing):** Place each number into a \"bucket\" corresponding to the value of its current digit. For decimal numbers, you'd typically have 10 buckets (0-9).\n    *   **Collection (Gathering):** Collect the numbers from the buckets in order, reconstructing the array.\n\n**Why is it efficient?**\nRadix sort's time complexity is O(d * (n + k)), where:\n*   `n` is the number of elements.\n*   `d` is the number of digits (or passes).\n*   `k` is the base of the number system (e.g., 10 for decimal numbers, or the range of values for each digit/character).\n\nIf `k` is not too large and `d` is relatively small (e.g., fixed-length integers), Radix Sort can be faster than comparison-based sorts like Quick Sort or Merge Sort (which have a best-case time complexity of O(n log n)).\n\n**Example Walkthrough (LSD Radix Sort):**\n\nLet's sort the array: `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`\n\n**Pass 1: Sort by the Units Digit (1s place)**\n*   Buckets:\n    *   0: [170, 90]\n    *   1: []\n    *   2: [802, 2]\n    *   3: []\n    *   4: [24]\n    *   5: [45, 75]\n    *   6: [66]\n    *   7: []\n    *   8: []\n    *   9: []\n*   Array after Pass 1: `[170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]`\n\n**Pass 2: Sort by the Tens Digit (10s place)**\n*   Buckets:\n    *   0: [802, 2]\n    *   1: [170]\n    *   2: [24]\n    *   3: []\n    *   4: [45]\n    *   5: []\n    *   6: [66]\n    *   7: [170, 75] (Note: 170 has 7 in tens place, 75 has 7)\n    *   8: []\n    *   9: [90]\n*   Array after Pass 2: `[802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170]` (Re-ordered to show stable sort, 170 was after 90 in previous step, now after 75)\n\n**Pass 3: Sort by the Hundreds Digit (1",
