Teams invest heavily in research and development to gain a competitive edge.\n*   **Championships:** There are two annual World Championships awarded:\n    *   **Drivers' Championship:** Awarded to the individual driver who accumulates the most points throughout the season.\n    *   **Constructors' Championship:** Awarded to the team (constructor) that accumulates the most points throughout the season, based on the combined performance of their two cars.\n*   **Race Format:** A typical Grand Prix weekend includes practice sessions, qualifying sessions (to determine the starting grid), and the main race on Sunday. Points are awarded to the top finishers in the race.\n*   **Speed and Excitement:** F1 cars are incredibly fast, capable of reaching speeds well over 300 km/h (186 mph), and races are often thrilling, with overtakes, strategic pit stops, and unpredictable outcomes.\n*   **History:** Formula 1 has a rich history dating back to 1950, with legendary drivers and iconic moments shaping its legacy.",
