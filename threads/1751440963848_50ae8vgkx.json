      "content": "Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits which share the same significant position and value. It's an efficient algorithm for sorting integers or strings.\n\nHere's how Radix Sort typically works:\n\n1.  **Determine Maximum Digits:** Find the maximum number of digits in the largest number in the array. This determines how many passes the algorithm will make.\n2.  **Iterate by Place Value:**\n    *   Start from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD).\n    *   For each digit position, use a stable sorting algorithm (like Counting Sort) to sort the numbers based on that specific digit.\n3.  **Counting Sort for Digits:**\n    *   Create 10 \"buckets\" (for digits 0-9).\n    *   Distribute the numbers into these buckets based on the value of their current significant digit.\n    *   Collect the numbers from the buckets in order (0 to 9) to form a new, partially sorted array.\n    *   Repeat this process for the next significant digit.\n\n**Why is it stable?**\nRadix sort relies on a stable sorting algorithm (like Counting Sort) for each pass. A stable sort preserves the relative order of equal elements. This is crucial because when we sort by a more significant digit, we want the relative order established by less significant digits to remain intact for numbers that have the same value for the current significant digit.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n*   **Best Case:** O(nk)\n*   **Average Case:** O(nk)\n*   **Worst Case:** O(nk)\n    Where `n` is the number of elements and `k` is the number of digits (or maximum number of digits in any number).\n    If `k` is considered constant (e.g., for fixed-size integers), then Radix Sort can be considered O(n). If `k` can be very large (e.g., for very large numbers or long strings), then it might not always outperform comparison sorts like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n + k) due to the buckets used in Counting Sort.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code Example for Radix Sort:\n\n```python\ndef counting_sort_for_radix(arr, exp):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs counting sort on the array based on the digit at 'exp' place.\n    exp is 10^i where i is the current digit position (0 for units, 1 for tens, etc.)\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    output = [0] * n\n    count = [0] * 10  # For digits 0-9\n\n    # Store count of occurrences in count[]\n    for i in range(n):\n        index = (arr[i] // exp) % 10\n        count[index] += 1\n\n    # Change count[i] so that count[i] now contains actual\n    # position of this digit in output[]\n    for i in range(1, 10):\n        count[i] += count[i - 1]\n\n    # Build the output array\n    i = n - 1\n    while i >= 0:\n        index = (arr[i] // exp) % 10\n        output[count[index] - 1] = arr[i]\n        count[index] -= 1\n        i -= 1\n\n    # Copy the output array to arr[], so that arr[] now\n    # contains sorted numbers according to current digit\n    for i in range(n):\n        arr[i] = output[i]\n\ndef radix_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of non-negative integers using Radix Sort.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not arr:\n        return\n\n    # Find the maximum number to know number of digits\n    max_val = max(arr)\n\n    # Do counting sort for every digit. Note that instead of passing digit number,\n    # exp is passed. exp is 10^i where i is current digit number\n    exp = 1\n    while max_val // exp > 0:\n        counting_sort_for_radix(arr, exp)\n        exp *= 10\n\n# Example Usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]\n    print(\"Original array:\", numbers)\n    radix_sort(numbers)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", numbers)\n\n    numbers2 = [329, 457, 657, 839, 436, 720, 355]\n    print(\"\\nOriginal array 2:\", numbers2)\n    radix_sort(numbers2)\n    print(\"Sorted array 2:\", numbers2)\n\n    numbers3 = [1, 10, 100, 1000, 5, 50, 500]\n    print(\"\\nOriginal array 3:\", numbers3)\n    radix_sort(numbers3)\n    print(\"Sorted array 3:\", numbers3)\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n\n1.  **`radix_sort(arr)` function:**\n    *   It first finds the `max_val` in the array. This is necessary to determine how many passes (based on digits) we need to make.\n    *   It then iterates using `exp` (exponent) which represents the current place value (1 for units, 10 for tens, 100 for hundreds, and so on).\n    *   In each iteration, it calls `counting_sort_for_radix` to sort the array based on the digit at the `exp` position.\n    *   The loop continues as long as `max_val // exp > 0`, meaning there are still digits to process for the largest number.\n\n2.  **`counting_sort_for_radix(arr, exp)` function:**\n    *   This is a modified Counting Sort. Instead of sorting based on the full number, it sorts based on `(arr[i] // exp) % 10`, which extracts the digit at the `exp` place.\n    *   `output = [0] * n`: An temporary array to store the sorted elements.\n    *   `count = [0] * 10`: An array to store the frequency of each digit (0-9).\n    *   **First loop (`for i in range(n)`):** Populates the `count` array by counting occurrences of each digit at the `exp` position.\n    *   **Second loop (`for i in range(1, 10)`):** Modifies `count` to store the actual position of the digits in the `output` array. This makes it a stable sort.\n    *   **Third loop (`while i >= 0`):** Builds the `output` array. It iterates backward to ensure stability. For each number, it determines its digit at the `exp` place, uses the `count` array to find its correct position in `output`, places it there, and then decrements the corresponding `count` value.\n    *   **Final loop:** Copies the sorted `output` array back into the original `arr`.\n\nThis implementation correctly sorts non-negative integers using the Radix Sort algorithm.",

      "content": "The term \"Ananya\" is primarily a popular given name, most commonly used in India. It is a Sanskrit word that means \"unique,\" \"matchless,\" or \"without a second.\" It is not a technical term, a data format, or something that typically requires \"decoding\" in a computational sense.\n\nTherefore, there isn't a specific \"code to decode Ananya\" because it's not data that has been encoded.\n\nHowever, if you are using \"Ananya\" as a placeholder for some *other* piece of information or data that has been encoded using a specific method (like Base64, URL encoding, etc.), then you would need to know the encoding method to provide the correct decoding code.\n\nFor example, if you meant to say you have a string that was encoded using **Base64** and you want to decode it, here's a general example in Python:\n\n**Example of Decoding Base64 (assuming \"Ananya\" was a placeholder for encoded data):**\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\ndef decode_base64_string(encoded_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Decodes a Base64 encoded string.\n    \n    Args:\n        encoded_string (str): The Base64 encoded string.\n        \n    Returns:\n        str: The decoded string.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Base64 strings are typically bytes, so we need to encode to bytes first\n        decoded_bytes = base64.b64decode(encoded_string)\n        # Then decode bytes to a UTF-8 string\n        decoded_string = decoded_bytes.decode('utf-8')\n        return decoded_string\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"Error decoding Base64: {e}\"\n\n# Example usage:\n# Let's say the word \"Ananya\" itself was Base64 encoded\noriginal_word = \"Ananya\"\nencoded_ananya = base64.b64encode(original_word.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')\nprint(f\"Original word: {original_word}\")\nprint(f\"Base64 Encoded: {encoded_ananya}\")\n\n# Now, let's decode it\ndecoded_result = decode_base64_string(encoded_ananya)\nprint(f\"Base64 Decoded: {decoded_result}\")\n\n# Another example with a different encoded string\nsome_encoded_data = \"SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\" # This decodes to \"Hello, World!\"\ndecoded_data = decode_base64_string(some_encoded_data)\nprint(f\"\\nExample of decoding 'SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==': {decoded_data}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n\n1.  **`import base64`**: This line imports Python's built-in `base64` module, which provides functions for encoding and decoding Base64 data.\n2.  **`decode_base64_string(encoded_string)` function**:\n    *   It takes one argument: `encoded_string`, which is the string you want to decode.\n    *   **`base64.b64decode(encoded_string)`**: This is the core function call. It takes the Base64 string (which must first be converted to bytes using `.encode('utf-8')` if it's a regular Python string) and decodes it into a sequence of bytes.\n    *   **`.decode('utf-8')`**: After decoding from Base64, the result is in bytes. To get a human-readable string, you typically need to decode these bytes into a string using a character encoding, commonly UTF-8.\n    *   The `try-except` block is included for robust error handling, in case the input string is not valid Base64.\n\nIf \"Ananya\" refers to something else in a specific context (e.g., a custom encryption, a data structure that needs parsing), please provide more details so I can give you more relevant information or code.",
