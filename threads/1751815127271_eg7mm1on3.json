      "content": "Here's an explanation of the code snippets found, in relation to your search for \"selection sort function\":\n\n1.  **`selection_sort` function (Python - `selection_sort.py`)**\n    *   **What it does:** This function implements the **Selection Sort algorithm**. It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning of the unsorted part.\n    *   **Relation to query:** This snippet is a direct match for your search query \"selection sort function\". It provides a clear and correct implementation of the algorithm.\n\n2.  **`Main` function (C# - `InsertionSort.cs`)**\n    *   **What it does:** This is the entry point (main method) for a C# program. It initializes an integer array, prints its initial state, calls a `Sort` function to sort it, and then prints the sorted array. It acts as a driver or test harness for a sorting algorithm.\n    *   **Relation to query:** While it deals with sorting, this function itself is not a \"selection sort function.\" It *uses* a sorting function, but the file name (`InsertionSort.cs`) and the subsequent `Sort` function suggest it's related to Insertion Sort, not Selection Sort.\n\n3.  **`Sort` function (C# - `InsertionSort.cs`)**\n    *   **What it does:** This function implements the **Insertion Sort algorithm**. It builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It iterates through the input elements and builds a sorted array by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.\n    *   **Relation to query:** This is a sorting function, but it is specifically **Insertion Sort**, not Selection Sort.\n\n**Key Differences and Similarities:**\n\n*   **Algorithm Type:** The Python `selection_sort` function implements Selection Sort. The C# `Sort` function (and its `Main` driver) implements Insertion Sort. These are two distinct sorting algorithms with different approaches to sorting.\n*   **Language:** The Selection Sort implementation is in Python, while the Insertion Sort implementation is in C#.\n*   **Purpose:** All snippets are related to sorting arrays, but only the first one directly matches your specific query for \"selection sort.\"\n\n**Insights and Recommendations:**\n\n*   You have successfully located a functional implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm in Python (`selection_sort.py`).\n*   The other two snippets provide an example of a different sorting algorithm (Insertion Sort) in C#. This could be useful if you are exploring various sorting techniques or need an example in C#.\n*   If your primary goal was to find a Selection Sort implementation, the Python file is the most relevant result.",
