      "content": "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural \"is-a\" relationship between classes.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its key aspects:\n\n1.  **Code Reusability:** Instead of writing the same code multiple times for different classes, you can define common attributes and methods in a base class and then have other classes inherit them. This reduces redundancy and makes your code more maintainable.\n\n2.  **\"Is-A\" Relationship:** Inheritance models a hierarchical relationship where a subclass \"is a\" type of its superclass. For example, a `Car` \"is a\" `Vehicle`, or a `Dog` \"is an\" `Animal`. This makes the code more intuitive and reflects real-world relationships.\n\n3.  **Extensibility:** Subclasses can extend or specialize the functionality inherited from their superclass. They can add new attributes, new methods, or override (redefine) existing methods to provide their own specific implementations.\n\n4.  **Polymorphism:** Inheritance is a prerequisite for polymorphism. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This means you can write more flexible and generic code that can operate on a variety of related objects.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider a base class `Animal` with properties like `name` and methods like `eat()` and `sleep()`.\n\n```\nClass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def eat(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} is eating.\")\n\n    def sleep(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} is sleeping.\")\n```\n\nNow, you can create subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from `Animal`:\n\n```\nClass Dog(Animal): # Dog inherits from Animal\n    def bark(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} is barking.\")\n\nClass Cat(Animal): # Cat inherits from Animal\n    def meow(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} is meowing.\")\n```\n\nIn this example:\n*   `Dog` and `Cat` automatically get the `name` property and the `eat()` and `sleep()` methods from `Animal`.\n*   They can also add their own specific behaviors (`bark()` for `Dog`, `meow()` for `Cat`).\n\nWhen you create instances:\n\n```\nmy_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\nmy_cat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n\nmy_dog.eat()    # Inherited from Animal\nmy_dog.bark()   # Specific to Dog\n\nmy_cat.sleep()  # Inherited from Animal\nmy_cat.meow()   # Specific to Cat\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how inheritance allows `Dog` and `Cat` to reuse the common `Animal` behaviors while also having their unique characteristics.",
