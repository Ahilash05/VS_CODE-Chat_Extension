      "content": "Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits which share the same significant position and value. It can be applied to data that can be sorted by creating a series of individual \"digits\" or \"components\".\n\nHere's a breakdown of how Radix Sort works, typically using the Least Significant Digit (LSD) approach:\n\n**Core Idea:**\nRadix sort works by processing digits from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD) or vice-versa. For each digit, it uses a stable sorting algorithm (like Counting Sort) to sort the numbers based on that digit.\n\n**Steps (LSD Radix Sort):**\n\n1.  **Find the Maximum Number:** Determine the largest number in the array to know the maximum number of digits any number has. This tells us how many passes we need to make.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Digits:** Perform a stable sort for each digit place, starting from the least significant digit (units place), then tens, hundreds, and so on, up to the most significant digit.\n\n    *   **Units Place (1s):** Sort all numbers based on their units digit. For example, if you have [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66], after sorting by units digit (using a stable sort like Counting Sort), it might look something like [170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66] (the relative order of 170 and 90, or 802 and 2, remains because they have the same units digit and the sort is stable).\n\n    *   **Tens Place (10s):** Now, take the partially sorted array and sort it based on the tens digit. Again, maintain stability. From the example above, if we sort [170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66] by the tens digit, it might become [2, 802, 24, 45, 66, 75, 170, 90].\n\n    *   **Hundreds Place (100s):** Repeat for the hundreds digit. Taking [2, 802, 24, 45, 66, 75, 170, 90] and sorting by hundreds digit: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802].\n\n3.  **Result:** After iterating through all significant digit places, the array will be fully sorted.\n\n**Why Counting Sort is often used as a subroutine:**\n\nCounting Sort is ideal for Radix Sort because it is a stable sorting algorithm. Stability means that if two numbers have the same value for the current digit being sorted, their relative order in the input array is preserved in the output array. This is crucial for Radix Sort to work correctly, as the previous sorts (on less significant digits) must not be undone by the current sort.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nLet's sort `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`\n\n*   **Max Digits:** Max number is 802 (3 digits). We need 3 passes.\n\n*   **Pass 1 (Units Digit):**\n    *   Original: `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`\n    *   Digits: `[0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 4, 2, 6]`\n    *   Sorted by units (stable sort): `",
