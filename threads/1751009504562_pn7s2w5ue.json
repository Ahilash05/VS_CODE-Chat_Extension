      "content": "Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the algorithm narrows the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, it narrows it to the upper half. This process continues until the value is found or the interval is empty.\n\nHere's an example of the binary search algorithm implemented in Python:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a binary search on a sorted list.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, otherwise -1.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2  # Calculate the middle index\n\n        # Check if target is present at mid\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        # If target is greater, ignore left half\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        # If target is smaller, ignore right half\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    \n    # If the target is not found in the array\n    return -1\n\n# Example Usage:\nsorted_list = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\nsearch_target_found = 23\nsearch_target_not_found = 100\n\nindex_found = binary_search(sorted_list, search_target_found)\nindex_not_found = binary_search(sorted_list, search_target_not_found)\n\nif index_found != -1:\n    print(f\"Element {search_target_found} found at index {index_found}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Element {search_target_found} not found in the list\")\n\nif index_not_found != -1:\n    print(f\"Element {search_target_not_found} found at index {index_not_found}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Element {search_target_not_found} not found in the list\")\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n\n1.  **`binary_search(arr, target)` function:**\n    *   Takes two arguments: `arr` (the sorted list) and `target` (the value to search for).\n    *   **`low = 0`**: Initializes a pointer `low` to the first index of the list.\n    *   **`high = len(arr) - 1`**: Initializes a pointer `high` to the last index of the list.\n\n2.  **`while low <= high:` Loop:**\n    *   This loop continues as long as the `low` pointer is less than or equal to the `high` pointer. This condition ensures that there's still a valid search space.\n\n3.  **`mid = (low + high) // 2`**:\n    *   Calculates the middle index of the current search interval. Integer division `//` is used to ensure `mid` is an integer.\n\n4.  **Comparison and Adjustment:**\n    *   **`if arr[mid] == target:`**:\n        *   If the element at the middle index is equal to the `target`, it means we found the element. The function returns `mid`, which is the index of the `target`.\n    *   **`elif arr[mid] < target:`**:\n        *   If the element at `mid` is less than the `target`, it means the `target` (if",
