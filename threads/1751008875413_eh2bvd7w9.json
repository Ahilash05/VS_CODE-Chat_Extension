      "content": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It's often used for problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. A recursive function must have a base case (a condition under which the function stops calling itself) to prevent infinite loops.\n\nHere's an example program in Python that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion.\n    Factorial of n (n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n    0! is defined as 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 5\nresult = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}\")\n\nnumber = 0\nresult = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}\")\n\nnumber = 7\nresult = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`factorial(n)` function:**\n    *   **Base Case (`if n == 0 or n == 1:`):** This is the crucial part that stops the recursion. The factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of 1 is also 1. When `n` reaches one of these values, the function returns directly without making further recursive calls.\n    *   **Recursive Case (`else: return n * factorial(n - 1)`):** For any `n` greater than 1, the function calculates `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`. It calls itself (`factorial(n - 1)`) with a smaller argument, moving closer to the base case.\n\n**How it works for `factorial(5)`:**\n\n1.  `factorial(5)` calls `5 * factorial(4)`\n2.  `factorial(4)` calls `4 * factorial(3)`\n3.  `factorial(3)` calls `3 * factorial(2)`\n4.  `factorial(2)` calls `2 * factorial(1)`\n5.  `factorial(1)` hits the base case and returns `1`.\n6.  `factorial(2)` receives `1` and returns `2 * 1 = 2`.\n7.  `factorial(3)` receives `2` and returns `3 * 2 = 6`.\n8.  `factorial(4)` receives `6` and returns `4 * 6 = 24`.\n9.  `factorial(5)` receives `24` and returns `5 * 24 = 120`.\n\nThis example clearly demonstrates the two essential components of a recursive function: a base case and a recursive step.",
