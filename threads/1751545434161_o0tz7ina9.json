      "content": "A subsidiary, often referred to as a \"daughter company,\" is a company that is owned or controlled by another company, known as the parent company or holding company.\n\nHere are the key characteristics of a subsidiary:\n\n*   **Control:** The parent company typically owns more than 50% of the subsidiary's voting stock, giving it a controlling interest. This control allows the parent company to influence the subsidiary's management, operations, and financial decisions.\n*   **Legal Entity:** Despite being controlled by a parent company, a subsidiary is usually a separate legal entity. This means it has its own distinct legal identity, can enter into contracts, own assets, incur debts, and be sued independently of its parent company.\n*   **Purpose:** Companies create or acquire subsidiaries for various strategic reasons, such as:\n    *   **Diversification:** Entering new markets or industries without directly impacting the parent company's core business.\n    *   **Risk Management:** Limiting liability, as the parent company's liability for the subsidiary's debts is typically limited to its investment in the subsidiary.\n    *   **Tax Advantages:** Utilizing different tax regimes in various jurisdictions.\n    *   **Operational Efficiency:** Allowing specialized operations or management structures.\n    *   **Brand Separation:** Maintaining distinct brand identities for different product lines or services.\n*   **Consolidated Financial Statements:** While legally separate, the financial results of subsidiaries are typically consolidated into the parent company's financial statements, providing a comprehensive view of the entire corporate group's performance.\n\nIn essence, a subsidiary operates under the umbrella of a larger parent company but maintains its own operational and legal identity.",
