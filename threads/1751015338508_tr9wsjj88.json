      "content": "Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data by processing individual digits. It works by sorting numbers digit by digit from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD), or vice versa. The key idea is to use a stable sorting algorithm (like Counting Sort) as a subroutine for each digit.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n**How Radix Sort Works:**\n\n1.  **Determine the Maximum Number of Digits (or Max Value):** Find the number with the maximum number of digits in the input array. This determines how many passes the sorting algorithm will make.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Digits:**\n    *   Start with the least significant digit (LSD).\n    *   For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.), perform a stable sort (typically Counting Sort) on the input array based on the value of that specific digit.\n    *   After sorting by one digit, the array is partially sorted.\n    *   Move to the next significant digit and repeat the process.\n\n3.  **Counting Sort as a Subroutine:**\n    *   Counting Sort is ideal for Radix Sort because it is stable (maintains the relative order of elements with equal values) and efficient for a limited range of integer keys.\n    *   For each pass (i.e., for each digit position `exp`):\n        *   Create a `count` array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) initialized to zeros.\n        *   Iterate through the input array and count the occurrences of each digit at the current `exp` position. For example, if `exp` is 10 (for tens place), for the number 123, the digit at this position is `(123 / 10) % 10 = 2`.\n        *   Modify the `count` array to store the actual position of each digit in the output array. This is done by adding the previous counts: `count[i] = count[i] + count[i-1]`.\n        *   Create an `output` array of the same size as the input array.\n        *   Iterate through the input array *from right to left* (to maintain stability) and place elements into the `output` array based on their digit's count and decrement the count.\n        *   Copy the elements from the `output` array back to the original input array.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nLet's sort the array `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]` using Radix Sort.\n\n*   **Max digits:** 3 (from 170, 802)\n\n**Pass 1: Sort by Units Digit (exp = 1)**\n\n*   Digits:\n    *   170 -> 0\n    *   45 -> 5\n    *   75 -> 5\n    *   90 -> 0\n    *   802 -> 2\n    *   24 -> 4\n    *   2 -> 2\n    *   66 -> 6\n\n*   Applying Counting Sort based on units digit:\n    *   Initial Array: `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`\n    *   Sorted by units digit: `[170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]` (Notice 2 comes before 802, and 45 before 75 due to stability)\n\n**Pass 2: Sort by Tens Digit (exp = 10)**\n\n*   Digits:\n    *   170 -> 7\n    *   90 -> 9\n    *   802 -> 0\n    *   2 -> 0\n    *   24 -> 2\n    *   45 -> 4\n    *   75 -> 7\n    *   66 -> 6\n\n*   ",
