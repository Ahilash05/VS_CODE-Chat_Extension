      "content": "Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits which share the same significant position and value. It works by processing digits from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD), or vice-versa.\n\nHere's how it generally works:\n\n1.  **Determine the maximum number of digits:** Find the number with the most digits in the input array. This determines how many passes the sort will need.\n2.  **Iterate through digit positions:** For each digit position (from LSD to MSD, or vice-versa):\n    *   **Stable Sort (e.g., Counting Sort):** Use a stable sorting algorithm (like counting sort) to sort the numbers based on the digit at the current position. A stable sort preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys, which is crucial for Radix Sort's correctness.\n    *   **Distribute into \"buckets\":** Create 10 \"buckets\" (0-9) for each possible digit value.\n    *   **Collect from buckets:** Place each number into the bucket corresponding to its digit at the current position.\n    *   **Reconstruct the array:** After all numbers have been placed into buckets, collect them back into the original array in order from bucket 0 to bucket 9.\n3.  **Repeat:** Repeat the process for the next significant digit until all digits have been processed.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n\n*   **Non-comparative:** It doesn't compare elements directly like Bubble Sort or Merge Sort.\n*   **Integer Keys:** It's primarily used for sorting integers or data that can be represented as integers.\n*   **Stable:** If a stable counting sort is used in each pass, Radix Sort itself will be stable.\n*   **Time Complexity:** Its time complexity is O(nk), where 'n' is the number of elements and 'k' is the number of digits (or the maximum number of digits). In cases where 'k' is small and constant (e.g., fixed-size integers), it can be faster than comparison-based sorts (O(n log n)).\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(n + k) or O(n + base) depending on the implementation, for the buckets and temporary arrays.\n\n**Example (LSD Radix Sort):**\n\nLet's sort the array: `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`\n\n**Pass 1: Sort by the unit's digit (LSD)**\n\n*   Buckets:\n    *   0: [170, 90]\n    *   1: []\n    *   2: [802, 2]\n    *   3: []\n    *   4: [24]\n    *   5: [45, 75]\n    *   6: [66]\n    *   7: []\n    *   8: []\n    *   9: []\n*   Array after pass 1: `[170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]`\n\n**Pass 2: Sort by the ten's digit**\n\n*   Buckets:\n    *   0: [802, 2]\n    *   1: [170]\n    *   2: [24]\n    *   3: []\n    *   4: [45]\n    *   5: []\n    *   6: [66]\n    *   7: [170, 75] (Note: 170 has '7' in tens place if we consider it as 070, but 170 should go to 7th bucket based on its 7. This is where padding or careful digit extraction is important. For 170, the tens digit is 7.",
