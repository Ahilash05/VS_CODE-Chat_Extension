      "content": "A system call is a programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system. They are the only way for a program to access hardware resources or other operating system services.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what that means:\n\n1.  **Kernel Interaction:** The kernel is the core of an operating system. It manages the system's resources (CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.) and provides fundamental services. User programs cannot directly access these resources or perform privileged operations.\n2.  **Requesting Services:** When a program needs to do something that requires kernel-level privileges or resources (like reading from a file, writing to the screen, creating a new process, allocating memory, or sending data over a network), it makes a system call.\n3.  **Interface:** System calls define a well-defined interface or API (Application Programming Interface) that application programs can use to interact with the operating system.\n4.  **Mode Switch:** When a program makes a system call, the CPU switches from \"user mode\" (where applications run with limited privileges) to \"kernel mode\" (where the operating system kernel runs with full privileges). This mode switch is crucial for security and system stability, as it prevents user programs from directly corrupting or misusing system resources.\n5.  **Examples:**\n    *   `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()` for file operations.\n    *   `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()` for process management.\n    *   `socket()`, `connect()`, `send()`, `recv()` for network communication.\n    *   `malloc()` (though often a library function, it internally uses system calls like `brk()` or `mmap()` for memory allocation).\n\nIn essence, system calls are the gatekeepers that allow user applications to safely and securely interact with the underlying hardware and the operating system's core functionalities.",
