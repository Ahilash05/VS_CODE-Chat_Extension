They are often mistakenly called \\\"koala bears,\\\" but they are not bears at all!</p>\\n        \\n        <img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Koala_eating_eucalyptus_leaves.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Koala eating eucalyptus leaves\\\">\\n\\n        <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>\\n        <p>Koalas primarily live in the eucalyptus forests of eastern and southern Australia. Their diet consists almost exclusively of eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most other animals. Koalas have a specialized digestive system that helps them detoxify these leaves. Due to the low nutritional value of eucalyptus, koalas spend most of their day sleeping, up to 18-20 hours!</p>\\n\\n        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>\\n        <ul>\\n            <li><strong>Size:</strong> They range from 60-85 cm (24-33 inches) in length and weigh between 4-15 kg (9-33 lbs), with males generally larger than females.</li>\\n            <li><strong>Fur:</strong> Their thick, woolly fur helps them insulate against both hot and cold weather.</li>\\n            <li><strong>Paws:</strong> They have strong, clawed paws adapted for gripping tree branches.</li>\\n            <li><strong>Nose:</strong> A large, dark, leathery nose is characteristic.</li>\\n        </ul>\\n\\n        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>\\n        <p>Unfortunately, koalas are facing significant threats, including habitat loss due to deforestation, bushfires, disease (like Chlamydia), and climate change. Their conservation status varies by region, but they are generally considered vulnerable or endangered in many parts of their range.</p>\\n\\n        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>\\n        <ul class=\\\"facts-list\\\">\\n            <li>Koalas rarely drink water, as they get most of their hydration from eucalyptus leaves. The name \\\"koala\\\" is often said to mean \\\"no drink\\\" in an Aboriginal language.</li>\\n            <li>They have a unique fingerprint, much like humans.</li>\\n            <li>Baby koalas are called \\\"joeys\\\" and stay in their mother's pouch for about six months.</li>\\n            <li>Koalas are nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night.</li>\\n        </ul>\\n\\n        <p>Let's do our part to protect these unique and precious creatures!</p>\\n    </div>\\n</body>\\n</html>\"}}",
