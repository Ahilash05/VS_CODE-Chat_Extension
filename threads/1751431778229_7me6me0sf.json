      "content": "Metamorphosis is a biological process by which an animal physically develops after birth or hatching, involving a conspicuous and relatively abrupt change in the animal's body structure through cell growth and differentiation. It is a profound change from one stage to the next in the life history of an organism.\n\nThis process is commonly observed in insects and amphibians.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   **Insects:** Many insects, like butterflies, moths, beetles, and flies, undergo complete metamorphosis, which involves four distinct stages:\n    1.  **Egg:** The life cycle begins as an egg.\n    2.  **Larva:** The egg hatches into a larva (e.g., caterpillar for butterflies, maggot for flies). This is primarily a feeding and growth stage.\n    3.  **Pupa:** The larva transforms into a pupa (e.g., chrysalis for butterflies, cocoon for moths). During this quiescent stage, significant reorganization of the body occurs.\n    4.  **Adult:** The adult emerges from the pupa. The adult stage is typically responsible for reproduction.\n    Other insects, like grasshoppers and cockroaches, undergo incomplete metamorphosis, which involves three stages: egg, nymph (a smaller version of the adult, molting several times), and adult.\n\n*   **Amphibians:** Frogs are a classic example of metamorphosis in amphibians:\n    1.  **Egg:** Frogs lay eggs, usually in water.\n    2.  **Tadpole (Larva):** The eggs hatch into aquatic tadpoles with gills for breathing underwater and a tail for swimming. They are typically herbivorous.\n    3.  **Metamorphosis:** The tadpole gradually develops lungs, loses its gills, grows limbs, and absorbs its tail. Its diet often shifts to carnivorous.\n    4.  **Adult Frog:** The adult frog is typically terrestrial or semi-aquatic and breathes with lungs and through its skin.\n\n**Significance of Metamorphosis:**\n\n*   **Reduced Competition:** It often allows different life stages to exploit different resources and habitats, reducing competition between juveniles and adults.\n*   **Dispersal:** The adult stage is often specialized for dispersal and reproduction.\n*   **Adaptation:** It allows for specialized adaptations at different life stages, optimizing survival and reproduction.",
