      "content": "Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data by processing individual digits. It works by sorting the numbers digit by digit, from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD), or vice-versa. The key idea is to use a stable sorting algorithm (like Counting Sort) for each digit.\n\nHere's how Radix Sort typically works (LSD Radix Sort):\n\n1.  **Determine the maximum number of digits:** Find the maximum number in the array to determine the number of passes needed.\n2.  **Iterate through digits:** For each digit position (from LSD to MSD):\n    *   **Create buckets (or queues):** Create 10 buckets (0-9) to hold numbers based on their current digit.\n    *   **Distribute numbers:** Iterate through the input array. For each number, extract the digit at the current position and place the number into the corresponding bucket.\n    *   **Collect numbers:** Concatenate the numbers from the buckets back into the array in order (from bucket 0 to bucket 9). This step maintains the relative order of numbers with the same digit, which is crucial for stability.\n3.  **Repeat:** Repeat step 2 for the next significant digit until all digits have been processed.\n\n**Why is it efficient?**\nRadix Sort's time complexity is O(d * (n + k)), where:\n*   `d` is the number of digits in the maximum number.\n*   `n` is the number of elements in the input array.\n*   `k` is the base of the number system (usually 10 for decimal numbers).\nIf `d` and `k` are small and constant, Radix Sort can be more efficient than comparison-based sorts (like Quick Sort or Merge Sort) which have a lower bound of O(n log n).\n\n**Example in Python:**\n\n```python\ndef counting_sort_for_radix(arr, exp):\n    \"\"\"\n    A stable counting sort used as a subroutine for Radix Sort.\n    Sorts arr based on the digit represented by 'exp' (e.g., exp=1 for units, exp=10 for tens).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    output = [0] * n  # Output array\n    count = [0] * 10  # Count array for digits 0-9\n\n    # Store count of occurrences in count[]\n    for i in range(n):\n        index = (arr[i] // exp) % 10\n        count[index] += 1\n\n    # Change count[i] so that count[i] now contains actual\n    # position of this digit in output[]\n    for i in range(1, 10):\n        count[i] += count[i - 1]\n\n    # Build the output array\n    # Iterate from the end to ensure stability\n    i = n - 1\n    while i >= 0:\n        index = (arr[i] // exp) % 10\n        output[count[index] - 1] = arr[i]\n        count[index] -= 1\n        i -= 1\n\n    # Copy the output array to arr[], so that arr[] now\n    # contains sorted numbers according to current digit\n    for i in range(n):\n        arr[i] = output[i]\n\ndef radix_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs Radix Sort on the given array.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find the maximum number to determine number of digits\n    max_val = max(arr)\n\n    # Do counting sort for every digit. Note that instead of passing digit number,\n    # exp is passed. exp is 10^i where i is current digit number\n    exp = 1\n    while max_val // exp > 0:\n        counting_sort_for_radix(arr, exp)\n        exp *= 10\n\n# Example Usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    numbers = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, ",
