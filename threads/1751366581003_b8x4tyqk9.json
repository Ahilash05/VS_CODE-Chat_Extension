      "content": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It's a powerful way to tackle problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.\n\nTo understand recursion, it's essential to grasp two key components:\n\n1.  **Base Case:** This is the condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop and eventually a stack overflow error. The base case provides a direct solution for the simplest form of the problem.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step:** This is where the function calls itself with a modified (usually smaller or simpler) version of the input. The idea is to reduce the problem to a simpler instance until it reaches the base case.\n\n### How Recursion Works:\n\nImagine you're trying to find your way through a maze. If you encounter a dead end, you backtrack. If you find a path, you follow it until you either reach the exit (base case) or another junction where you have to make a choice (recursive step). Each time you make a choice, you're essentially calling the \"solve maze\" function again for a smaller part of the maze.\n\n### Example: Calculating Factorial\n\nA classic example of recursion is calculating the factorial of a non-negative integer. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\nFor example:\n*   `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`\n*   `0! = 1` (by definition, this serves as our base case)\n\nWe can define `n!` recursively as:\n*   `n! = 1` if `n = 0` (Base Case)\n*   `n! = n * (n-1)!` if `n > 0` (Recursive Step)\n\nHere's how you might implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    # Base Case: If n is 0, the factorial is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive Step: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(f\"Factorial of 0: {factorial(0)}\")\nprint(f\"Factorial of 1: {factorial(1)}\")\nprint(f\"Factorial of 5: {factorial(5)}\")\nprint(f\"Factorial of 7: {factorial(7)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation of the `factorial(5)` call:**\n\n1.  `factorial(5)` is called. Since `5 != 0`, it goes to the `else` block.\n    *   Returns `5 * factorial(4)`\n2.  `factorial(4)` is called. Since `4 != 0`, it goes to the `else` block.\n    *   Returns `4 * factorial(3)`\n3.  `factorial(3)` is called. Since `3 != 0`, it goes to the `else` block.\n    *   Returns `3 * factorial(2)`\n4.  `factorial(2)` is called. Since `2 != 0`, it goes to the `else` block.\n    *   Returns `2 * factorial(1)`\n5.  `factorial(1)` is called. Since `1 != 0`, it goes to the `else` block.\n    *   Returns `1 * factorial(0)`\n6.  `factorial(0)` is called. Since `0 == 0`, it hits the base case.\n    *   Returns `1`\n\nNow, the results are passed back up the call stack:\n\n*   `factorial(1)` receives `1` from `factorial(0)`, so it returns `1 * 1 =",
