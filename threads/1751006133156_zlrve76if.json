      "content": "A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element, often called a \"node,\" contains two parts:\n\n1.  **Data:** The actual value or information stored in the node.\n2.  **Pointer (or Reference):** A link to the next node in the sequence.\n\nThe first node in a linked list is called the **head**, and it is used to access the entire list. The last node in the list points to `NULL` (or `None` in some languages) to indicate the end of the list.\n\n**Key Characteristics of Linked Lists:**\n\n*   **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink in size during execution as needed, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.\n*   **Ease of Insertion/Deletion:** Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is relatively efficient, as it only requires updating a few pointers. In arrays, insertion/deletion can involve shifting many elements.\n*   **Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation:** Nodes are scattered in memory, and the links between them are established by pointers.\n*   **No Random Access:** To access an element at a specific position, you must traverse the list from the head, node by node. This means random access (like `array[index]`) is not directly supported.\n\n**Types of Linked Lists:**\n\n1.  **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node in the sequence. Traversal is only possible in one direction (forward).\n2.  **Doubly Linked List:** Each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node and one pointing to the previous node. This allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions.\n3.  **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node (head), forming a circle. This can be either singly or doubly linked.\n\n**Common Use Cases:**\n\n*   Implementing stacks and queues.\n*   Managing dynamic memory allocation (e.g., in operating systems).\n*   Representing polynomial expressions.\n*   Implementing hash tables (using separate chaining for collision resolution).\n*   Creating undo/redo functionalities in applications.",
