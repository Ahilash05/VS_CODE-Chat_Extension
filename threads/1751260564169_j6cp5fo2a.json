      "content": "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\nHere's how insertion sort works step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Iterate through the array**: Start from the second element (index 1) and go up to the last element. The first element (index 0) is considered already sorted.\n\n2.  **Pick an element**: In each iteration, pick the current element you are looking at. Let's call this `key`.\n\n3.  **Compare and Shift**: Compare `key` with the elements in the sorted portion of the array (which is to its left).\n    *   If an element in the sorted portion is greater than `key`, shift it one position to the right.\n    *   Continue shifting elements to the right until you find an element that is less than or equal to `key`, or you reach the beginning of the array.\n\n4.  **Insert**: Insert `key` into the position where the shifting stopped.\n\n5.  **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-4 for all remaining unsorted elements.\n\n**Analogy:**\nThink of sorting a hand of playing cards. You hold the cards in your hand, and they are sorted. When you pick up a new card from the table, you compare it with the cards in your hand from right to left. If the new card is smaller, you shift the larger cards to the right to make space, and then you insert the new card into its correct position.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nLet's sort the array `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6]` using insertion sort.\n\n*   **Initial Array:** `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6]`\n\n*   **Pass 1 (i = 1, key = 11):**\n    *   Sorted part: `[12]`\n    *   `key = 11`. Compare `11` with `12`.\n    *   `12 > 11`, so shift `12` to the right. Array becomes `[_, 12, 13, 5, 6]`\n    *   Insert `11` at the beginning.\n    *   **Array:** `[11, 12, 13, 5, 6]`\n\n*   **Pass 2 (i = 2, key = 13):**\n    *   Sorted part: `[11, 12]`\n    *   `key = 13`. Compare `13` with `12`.\n    *   `12 < 13`, so `13` is already in its correct position relative to `11` and `12`. No shifting needed.\n    *   **Array:** `[11, 12, 13, 5, 6]`\n\n*   **Pass 3 (i = 3, key = 5):**\n    *   Sorted part: `[11, 12, 13]`\n    *   `key = 5`. Compare `5` with `13`.\n    *   `13 > 5`, shift `13` right. Array: `[11, 12, _, 13, 6]`\n    *   Compare `5` with `12`.\n    *   `12 > 5`, shift `12` right. Array: `[11, _, 12, 13, 6]`\n    *   Compare `5` with `11`.\n    *   `11 > 5`, shift `11` right. Array: `[_, 11, 12, 13, 6]`\n    *   Insert `5` at the beginning.\n    *   **Array:** `[5, 11, 12, 13, 6]`\n\n*   **",

      "content": "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\nHere's the Python code for insertion sort:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array using the Insertion Sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr: The list of elements to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are\n        # greater than key, to one position ahead\n        # of their current position\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_list = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]\n    print(f\"Original list: {my_list}\")\n    sorted_list = insertion_sort(my_list)\n    print(f\"Sorted list: {sorted_list}\") # Output: Sorted list: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]\n\n    my_list_2 = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\n    print(f\"Original list: {my_list_2}\")\n    sorted_list_2 = insertion_sort(my_list_2)\n    print(f\"Sorted list: {sorted_list_2}\") # Output: Sorted list: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n```\n\n**Explanation of the code:**\n\n1.  **Outer Loop (`for i in range(1, len(arr))`):** This loop iterates from the second element (`i = 1`) up to the last element of the array. The first element (`arr[0]`) is considered already sorted.\n2.  **`key = arr[i]`:** In each iteration, the current element `arr[i]` is chosen as the `key` to be inserted into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array (elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`).\n3.  **`j = i - 1`:** A pointer `j` is initialized to the last element of the sorted subarray.\n4.  **Inner Loop (`while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]`):** This loop compares the `key` with elements in the sorted subarray, moving backwards from `j` to `0`.\n    *   If an element `arr[j]` is greater than the `key`, it means `arr[j]` is not in its correct position relative to `key`. So, `arr[j]` is shifted one position to the right (`arr[j + 1] = arr[j]`).\n    *   The `j` pointer is decremented (`j -= 1`) to move to the previous element in the sorted subarray.\n5.  **`arr[j + 1] = key`:** Once the inner loop finishes (either `j` becomes less than 0 or `key` is no longer smaller than `arr[j]`), it means the correct position for `key` has been found. The `key` is then inserted at `arr[j + 1]`.\n\nInsertion sort is efficient for small data sets and nearly sorted data sets.",
