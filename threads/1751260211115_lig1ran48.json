      "content": "Approaching LeetCode problems effectively involves a structured methodology. Here's a comprehensive guide:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem Thoroughly:**\n    *   Read the problem description multiple times.\n    *   Identify the input format, output format, constraints (e.g., time complexity, space complexity, data range), and any edge cases.\n    *   Clarify any ambiguities by asking \"what if\" questions.\n    *   Work through the given examples step-by-step to ensure you understand the expected behavior. Create your own simple test cases.\n\n2.  **Brainstorm Solutions (High-Level):**\n    *   Don't jump straight into coding. Think about different approaches.\n    *   **Brute Force:** Can you solve it in the most straightforward, albeit inefficient, way? This helps establish a baseline and ensures you understand the core logic.\n    *   **Optimization:** How can you improve the brute-force solution?\n        *   Can you use a different data structure (e.g., hash map, set, heap, stack, queue, trie, segment tree)?\n        *   Can you apply common algorithmic paradigms (e.g., Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Greedy, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, BFS/DFS)?\n        *   Can you sort the input?\n    *   **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:** For each potential approach, estimate its time and space complexity. This helps you choose the most efficient one that meets the constraints.\n\n3.  **Choose the Best Approach & Plan:**\n    *   Select the most optimal approach you've identified that fits the constraints.\n    *   Outline the steps involved in your chosen algorithm. This can be pseudocode, bullet points, or even just a mental walkthrough. This plan acts as a roadmap for your coding.\n\n4.  **Implement the Solution:**\n    *   Write clean, readable code.\n    *   Break down the problem into smaller, manageable functions if necessary.\n    *   Use meaningful variable names.\n    *   Add comments where the logic is complex or non-obvious.\n    *   Handle edge cases explicitly (e.g., empty inputs, single-element inputs, maximum/minimum constraints).\n\n5.  **Test Your Code:**\n    *   Use the example test cases provided by LeetCode.\n    *   Create your own custom test cases, especially for edge cases you identified in step 1.\n    *   Think about:\n        *   Minimum input size.\n        *   Maximum input size.\n        *   Inputs that produce zero, negative, or large results.\n        *   Inputs with duplicates, unique elements, sorted/unsorted data.\n    *   If your code fails, debug systematically. Use print statements or a debugger to trace variable values and execution flow.\n\n6.  **Refactor and Optimize (If Necessary):**\n    *   Once your code passes all tests, review it.\n    *   Can you make it more concise or readable without sacrificing performance?\n    *   Are there any minor optimizations you missed? (e.g., avoiding redundant calculations).\n    *   This step is less about finding a new algorithm and more about polishing your existing one.\n\n7.  **Learn from Solutions (Crucial!):**\n    *   After solving (or struggling with) a problem, always look at the official solutions or top-voted community solutions.\n    *   Understand different approaches, even if you solved it.\n    *   Pay attention to clever tricks, data structures, or algorithmic patterns you didn't think of.\n    *   This is how you expand your problem-solving toolkit.\n\n**General Tips for LeetCode Success:**\n\n*   **Start with Easy Problems:** Build a strong foundation in basic data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion).\n*   **Practice Consistently:** Regular practice is key. Aim for at least one problem a day, or a few problems several times a week.\n*   **Focus on Patterns:** Many LeetCode problems fall into common categories (e.g., Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming, BFS/DFS). Learning these patterns will help you recognize them in new problems.\n*   **Don't Be Afraid to Get Stuck:** It's part of the learning process. If you're stuck for more than 30-60 minutes,",
