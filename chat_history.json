It allows a program to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.\n\n**How recursion works:**\n\n1. A function calls itself.\n2. The function then executes the same code block again.\n3. This process repeats until the condition is met.\n4. Once the condition is met, the recursion stops, and the function returns a result.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    return n * factorial(n-1)\n```\n\nThis code defines a factorial function that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number n. The function calls itself with the parameter n-1 until it reaches the base case (n == 0), which returns 1.",

    "content": "Sure, here's an explanation of recursion:\n\n**Recursion** is a technique used by AI assistants to handle complex tasks by recursively calling other AI assistants or tools to break down the problem into smaller, manageable subtasks.\n\n**Benefits of recursion:**\n\n* **Efficiency:** It can significantly reduce the time taken to complete a task by parallelizing the process across multiple threads.\n* **Flexibility:** It allows AI assistants to handle recursive problems of various complexities.\n* **Improved accuracy:** By iteratively processing the subtasks, it can provide more accurate results.\n\n**How recursion works:**\n\n1. When an AI assistant receives a request, it evaluates the task and determines the most appropriate tool or method to handle it.\n2. Based on the tool called, the assistant creates a sub-request with the relevant parameters.\n3. The sub-request is then sent to the chosen tool, which returns a result.\n4. The AI assistant processes the result and combines it with the initial result to provide a response.\n5. The entire process repeats until the task is completed.\n\n**Example:**\n\nConsider a scenario where an AI assistant wants to find the average age of its users. It could use recursion to achieve this:\n\n1. The assistant calls the `GetOSInfo` tool to determine the operating system.\n2. If the OS is Windows, the assistant calls the `GetUserAge` tool to calculate the average age of Windows users.\n3. If the OS is Ubuntu, the assistant calls the `GetLinuxUserAge` tool to get the average age of Ubuntu users.\n4. Finally, the average age is calculated and returned as the result.\n\n**Advantages of using recursion:**\n\n* Efficient and efficient for complex tasks.\n* Provides flexibility for handling different scenarios.\n* Can improve accuracy and provide more comprehensive results.\n\n**Note:**\n\nRecursion can have limitations, including:\n\n* **Stack overflow:** If a recursive task exceeds the available stack space, it can cause a stack overflow error.\n* **Singularity:** In some cases, recursion can create a singularity where the AI assistant becomes infinitely recursive.\n* **Memory limitations:** Recursion can consume significant memory resources, especially for long-running tasks.",

Companies are required to file their annual financial statements (Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss Account, Cash Flow Statement, etc.) along with the Board's Report and Auditor's Report using this form. It can be filed in a PDF format.\n\n*   **AOC-4 XBRL:** This is a specific version of the AOC-4 form that requires financial statements to be filed in **XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)** format. XBRL is an open international standard for digital business reporting, managed by XBRL International. It uses a structured data format that allows for easier analysis, comparison, and exchange of financial information. Certain classes of companies, as specified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), are mandated to file their financial statements in XBRL format. This typically includes:\n    *   All listed companies and their subsidiaries.\n    *   Companies with a paid-up capital of Rs. 5 crore or more.\n    *   Companies with a turnover of Rs. 100 crore or more.\n\nIn essence, AOC-4 is the form itself, while AOC-4 XBRL specifies that the data within that form (the financial statements) must be presented in the machine-readable and standardized XBRL format, rather than just a standard PDF. This makes the data more accessible for regulatory analysis and public consumption.",

    "content": "Debugging code is an essential skill for any developer. Here are a few common and effective techniques:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** Before you start debugging, make sure you thoroughly understand what the code is supposed to do and what it's actually doing (or failing to do). Reproduce the bug consistently if possible.\n\n2.  **Use a Debugger:**\n    *   **Breakpoints:** Set breakpoints at specific lines of code where you suspect the error might be. When the program execution reaches a breakpoint, it pauses, allowing you to inspect the state of variables.\n    *   **Step-Through Execution:** Once paused, you can \"step over\" (execute the current line and move to the next), \"step into\" (enter a function call), or \"step out\" (finish the current function and return to the caller). This helps you follow the flow of execution.\n    *   **Variable Inspection:** While paused, examine the values of variables, objects, and data structures. This is crucial for identifying incorrect states or unexpected values.\n    *   **Call Stack:** Look at the call stack to understand the sequence of function calls that led to the current point of execution.\n\n3.  **Print/Log Statements:**\n    *   Temporarily insert `print()`, `console.log()`, `System.out.println()`, or similar logging statements throughout your code.\n    *   Use them to output the values of variables, the flow of execution (e.g., \"Entering function X\", \"Exiting loop Y\"), or error messages.\n    *   This is a simple yet powerful technique, especially when a full-fledged debugger isn't readily available or convenient. Remember to remove or disable them once the bug is fixed.\n\n4.  **Rubber Duck Debugging:**\n    *   Explain your code, line by line, to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck) or even an imaginary person.\n    *   The act of articulating your code's logic often helps you spot flaws or assumptions you weren't aware of.\n\n5.  **Divide and Conquer (Bisection Method):**\n    *   If you have a large block of code where the bug might be, try to narrow down the problematic section.\n    *   Comment out half the code and see if the bug persists. If it does, the bug is in the remaining half. If not, it's in the commented-out part. Repeat this process until you isolate the exact location.\n\n6.  **Test Driven Development (TDD):**\n    *   While not strictly a debugging technique, writing tests *before* writing the code can prevent many bugs from occurring in the first place.\n    *   When a bug does appear, you can write a failing test case that specifically reproduces the bug, then fix the code until that test passes. This ensures the bug stays fixed.\n\n7.  **Version Control (e.g., Git `bisect`):**\n    *   If a bug recently appeared and you're not sure which change introduced it, you can use `git bisect` (or similar features in other VCS) to automatically perform a binary search through your commit history. You mark commits as \"good\" (bug not present) or \"bad\" (bug present), and Git helps you pinpoint the exact commit that introduced the issue.\n\n8.  **Simplification/Isolation:**\n    *   Try to create the smallest possible code snippet that still reproduces the bug. This often helps in understanding the core issue by removing extraneous factors.\n\n9.  **Check Assumptions:**\n    *   Often, bugs arise from incorrect assumptions about input, data types, function behavior, or external system responses. Explicitly verify your assumptions.\n\n10. **Read Error Messages Carefully:**\n    *   Don't just glance at error messages. Read them thoroughly. They often contain valuable information, including the file name, line number, and a description of what went wrong. Stack traces are particularly useful.\n\nBy combining these techniques, you can efficiently identify, understand, and resolve issues in your code.",

    "content": "Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem. It's a powerful technique often used to break down complex problems into simpler, more manageable sub-problems.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works and its key components:\n\n1.  **Base Case:** Every recursive function must have at least one base case. This is a condition that stops the recursion from continuing indefinitely. When the base case is met, the function returns a result without making further recursive calls. Without a base case, the function would call itself forever, leading to a stack overflow error.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step (or Recursive Case):** This is the part of the function where it calls itself with a modified input. The idea is to reduce the problem to a smaller version of the same problem, moving closer to the base case with each call.\n\n**How it works (Conceptual Flow):**\n\nImagine you want to calculate the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\n*   **Factorial(n):**\n    *   **Base Case:** If n is 0 or 1, return 1 (because 0! = 1 and 1! = 1).\n    *   **Recursive Step:** If n > 1, return n * Factorial(n-1).\n\nLet's trace Factorial(3):\n\n1.  `Factorial(3)` calls `3 * Factorial(2)`\n2.  `Factorial(2)` calls `2 * Factorial(1)`\n3.  `Factorial(1)` hits the base case and returns `1`\n4.  Now, `Factorial(2)` gets `1` back, so it calculates `2 * 1 = 2` and returns `2`\n5.  Finally, `Factorial(3)` gets `2` back, so it calculates `3 * 2 = 6` and returns `6`\n\n**When to use Recursion:**\n\nRecursion is particularly well-suited for problems that can be defined in terms of smaller, similar sub-problems. Common examples include:\n\n*   **Tree and Graph Traversal:** Algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS).\n*   **Divide and Conquer Algorithms:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort.\n*   **Mathematical Functions:** Factorial, Fibonacci sequence.\n*   **Parsing and Language Processing:** Dealing with nested structures.\n\n**Advantages of Recursion:**\n\n*   **Elegance and Readability:** For certain problems, recursive solutions can be more intuitive and closely mirror the mathematical definition of the problem.\n*   **Reduced Code:** Can often lead to more concise code compared to iterative solutions for the same problem.\n\n**Disadvantages of Recursion:**\n\n*   **Performance Overhead:** Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, which consumes memory and can be slower due to function call overhead.\n*   **Stack Overflow:** If the recursion goes too deep (i.e., too many nested calls without reaching a base case), it can lead to a stack overflow error, as the call stack runs out of memory.\n*   **Debugging Difficulty:** Tracing recursive calls can sometimes be more challenging than tracing iterative loops.\n\nIn many cases, a recursive solution can also be implemented iteratively (using loops). The choice between recursion and iteration often depends on the specific problem, performance requirements, and code readability preferences.",

Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1.  **Modularity:** Functions break down a large program into smaller, manageable, and organized pieces. This makes the program easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n2.  **Reusability:** Once a function is defined, it can be called multiple times from different parts of your program without rewriting the same code. This saves time and reduces redundancy.\n3.  **Abstraction:** Functions allow you to hide the complex implementation details and expose only what's necessary. You can use a function without knowing exactly how it works internally, as long as you know what it does and what inputs it expects.\n4.  **Parameters and Return Values:**\n    *   **Parameters (or arguments):** Functions can accept input values, called parameters, which allow them to operate on different data each time they are called.\n    *   **Return Value:** A function can also produce an output, known as a return value, which can then be used by the part of the code that called the function.\n\nIn programming, you define a function once, and then you can \"call\" or \"invoke\" it whenever you need to perform that specific action.",

The problem is simplified in each recursive call until it reaches a point where the base case can handle it.\n\n**How it works (Conceptual Flow):**\n\n*   When a recursive function is called, it first checks if the base case is met.\n*   If the base case is met, it performs the required operation and returns the result.\n*   If the base case is not met, it performs some operations and then calls itself with a slightly simpler version of the original problem.\n*   This process continues until the base case is reached.\n*   Once the base case returns a value, the results of the subsequent recursive calls are evaluated back up the call stack, until the initial call returns the final result.\n\n**Analogy:**\n\nA common analogy for recursion is looking up a word in a dictionary. If the word isn't immediately found on the current page, you might be told to \"see page X.\" You then go to page X and repeat the process. The base case is when you find the word on the current page. The recursive step is going to \"see page X.\"\n\n**Example (Factorial Calculation):**\n\nCalculating the factorial of a non-negative integer `n` (denoted as `n!`) is a classic example:\n`n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1`\nAnd `0! = 1`\n\n**Recursive Definition:**\n*   **Base Case:** If `n` is 0, `n!` is 1.\n*   **Recursive Step:** If `n` is greater than 0, `n!` is `n * (n-1)!`\n\nA simple Python example:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    # Base Case\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive Step\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(factorial(5)) # Output: 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n```\n\n**Advantages of Recursion:**\n\n*   **Elegance and Readability:** For problems that are inherently recursive (like tree traversals, quicksort, mergesort), a recursive solution can be much more intuitive and easier to read than an iterative one.\n*   **Reduced Code:** Can often lead to more concise code.\n\n**Disadvantages of Recursion:**\n\n*   **Memory Usage (Stack Overflow):** Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. If the recursion goes too deep (e.g., for very large inputs without a proper base case or if the problem size isn't reduced efficiently), it can lead to a \"stack overflow\" error.\n*   **Performance Overhead:** The overhead of managing the call stack can sometimes make recursive solutions slower than iterative ones for certain problems.\n*   **Debugging:** Debugging recursive functions can be more challenging due to the call stack.\n\nIn summary, recursion is a powerful problem-solving technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem, relying on a base case to terminate the process.",

It's like breaking down a big problem into smaller, similar sub-problems until a simple base case is reached, which can be solved directly.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key components of recursion:\n\n1.  **Base Case:** This is the most crucial part. It's a condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop (or a stack overflow error). The base case defines the simplest possible scenario of the problem that can be solved without further recursion.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step (or Recursive Call):** This is where the function calls itself with a modified input. The input is typically modified in a way that moves it closer to the base case. Each recursive call works on a smaller version of the original problem.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nImagine you want to calculate the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\n*   **Recursive Definition:** `n! = n * (n-1)!`\n*   **Base Case:** `0! = 1` or `1! = 1`\n\nLet's trace `factorial(5)`:\n1.  `factorial(5)` calls `5 * factorial(4)`\n2.  `factorial(4)` calls `4 * factorial(3)`\n3.  `factorial(3)` calls `3 * factorial(2)`\n4.  `factorial(2)` calls `2 * factorial(1)`\n5.  `factorial(1)` returns `1` (Base Case)\n6.  `factorial(2)` receives `1`, calculates `2 * 1 = 2` and returns `2`\n7.  `factorial(3)` receives `2`, calculates `3 * 2 = 6` and returns `6`\n8.  `factorial(4)` receives `6`, calculates `4 * 6 = 24` and returns `24`\n9.  `factorial(5)` receives `24`, calculates `5 * 24 = 120` and returns `120`\n\n**Advantages of Recursion:**\n\n*   **Elegance and Readability:** For certain problems (like tree traversals, graph algorithms, or mathematical sequences), a recursive solution can be much more concise and easier to understand than an iterative one.\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** It naturally reflects the recursive nature of some problems, making the solution intuitive.\n\n**Disadvantages of Recursion:**\n\n*   **Performance Overhead:** Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. This can consume a significant amount of memory and time, especially for deep recursion.\n*   **Stack Overflow:** If the recursion goes too deep without reaching a base case, it can lead to a \"stack overflow\" error, as the call stack runs out of memory.\n*   **Debugging Difficulty:** Tracing the flow of a recursive function can be more challenging than an iterative loop.\n\n**When to use Recursion:**\n\nRecursion is often best suited for problems that can be defined in terms of smaller, similar sub-problems. Common examples include:\n\n*   Tree and graph traversals (e.g., Depth-First Search)\n*   Fractals\n*   Mathematical functions (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci sequence)\n*   Sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)\n*   Backtracking algorithms\n\nWhile powerful, it's important to consider whether an iterative solution might be more efficient or appropriate for a given problem, especially concerning performance and memory usage.",

It's often used when a problem can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key concepts of recursion:\n\n1.  **Base Case:** Every recursive function must have one or more base cases. This is a condition that tells the function when to stop recursing. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error. The base case provides a direct solution for the simplest form of the problem.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step (or Recursive Call):** This is where the function calls itself with a modified input, moving closer to the base case. The idea is to solve a smaller part of the problem and then combine the results to solve the larger problem.\n\n**How it works (The Call Stack):**\n\nWhen a recursive function is called, each call is placed onto the call stack. When a base case is reached, the function starts returning values, and these calls are popped off the stack one by one, combining results until the initial call returns the final answer.\n\n**Analogy:**\n\nThink of it like a set of Russian nesting dolls (Matryoshka dolls).\n*   You open a doll (function call).\n*   Inside, you find a smaller, identical doll (recursive call with a smaller problem).\n*   You keep opening dolls until you find the smallest doll that doesn't contain another doll (the base case).\n*   Then, you close that smallest doll, then the next largest, and so on, until you've closed all the dolls and returned to the original one.\n\n**Example in Python (Factorial Calculation):**\n\nLet's illustrate with a classic example: calculating the factorial of a number `n` (n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 1).\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    # Base Case: If n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.\n    # This stops the recursion.\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive Step: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    # The function calls itself with a smaller problem (n-1)\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Let's trace factorial(4):\n# factorial(4)\n#   -> 4 * factorial(3)\n#      -> 3 * factorial(2)\n#         -> 2 * factorial(1)\n#            -> 1 (Base Case reached, returns 1)\n#         -> 2 * 1 = 2 (returns 2)\n#      -> 3 * 2 = 6 (returns 6)\n#   -> 4 * 6 = 24 (returns 24)\n\nprint(factorial(4)) # Output: 24\nprint(factorial(0)) # Output: 1\nprint(factorial(5)) # Output: 120\n```\n\n**When to use recursion:**\n\n*   **Problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems:** Examples include tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder), graph algorithms (DFS), quicksort, mergesort, Fibonacci sequence, etc.\n*   **When the recursive solution is more natural and readable:** Sometimes, a recursive solution is more elegant and easier to understand than an iterative one (though not always more efficient).\n\n**Potential Drawbacks:**\n\n*   **Stack Overflow:** If the base case is not reached, or if the recursion depth is too large, it can lead to a stack overflow error due to excessive function calls on the call stack.\n*   **Performance Overhead:** Each function call adds overhead (memory for the call stack, time for context switching), so iterative solutions can sometimes be more efficient for certain problems.\n*   **Debugging Complexity:** Tracing recursive calls can sometimes be harder than tracing iterative loops.\n\nIn summary, recursion is a fundamental programming concept that allows functions to call themselves, providing an elegant way to",

The first element (`arr[0]`) is considered to be a sorted sub-array of size 1.\n    *   `int key = arr[i];` stores the current element that needs to be inserted into its correct position within the already sorted part of the array (`arr[0...i-1]`).\n    *   `int j = i - 1;` initializes `j` to the last index of the sorted sub-array.\n    *   The `while` loop compares `key` with elements in the sorted sub-array (`arr[j]`).\n        *   If an element `arr[j]` is greater than `key`, it means `key` should be inserted before `arr[j]`. So, `arr[j]` is shifted one position to the right (`arr[j + 1] = arr[j];`).\n        *   `j` is decremented to move to the previous element in the sorted sub-array.\n    *   This shifting continues until `j` becomes less than 0 (meaning `key` is the smallest element and should be placed at the beginning) or an element `arr[j]` is found that is less than or equal to `key`.\n    *   `arr[j + 1] = key;` finally places `key` into its correct sorted position.\n\n2.  **`printArray(",

    "content": "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort has some advantages:\n\n*   **Simple implementation:** It's very easy to understand and code.\n*   **Efficient for small data sets:** It performs well on small lists.\n*   **More efficient than other simple quadratic algorithms:** For example, it's generally more efficient than selection sort or bubble sort.\n*   **Adaptive:** It is efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted, as its time complexity approaches O(n + d), where `d` is the number of inversions.\n*   **Stable:** It does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys.\n*   **In-place:** It only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space.\n\nHere's an example of the insertion sort algorithm implemented in Python:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr: The list of elements to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        The sorted list.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)\n    # The first element (arr[0]) is considered sorted.\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        key = arr[i]  # The element to be inserted into the sorted part\n\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key,\n        # to one position ahead of their current position\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n\n# Example Usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_list = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]\n    print(f\"Original list: {my_list}\")\n    sorted_list = insertion_sort(my_list)\n    print(f\"Sorted list: {sorted_list}\")\n\n    my_list_2 = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3]\n    print(f\"Original list: {my_list_2}\")\n    sorted_list_2 = insertion_sort(my_list_2)\n    print(f\"Sorted list: {sorted_list_2}\")\n\n    my_list_3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # Already sorted\n    print(f\"Original list: {my_list_3}\")\n    sorted_list_3 = insertion_sort(my_list_3)\n    print(f\"Sorted list: {sorted_list_3}\")\n\n    my_list_4 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] # Reverse sorted\n    print(f\"Original list: {my_list_4}\")\n    sorted_list_4 = insertion_sort(my_list_4)\n    print(f\"Sorted list: {sorted_list_4}\")\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  **Iteration:** The algorithm iterates from the second element (`arr[1]`) up to the last element (`arr[n-1]`).\n2.  **Key Selection:** In each iteration, the current element (`arr[i]`) is picked and stored as `key`. This `key` is to be inserted into the correct position in the already sorted sub-array `arr[0...i",

It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the algorithm narrows the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, it narrows it to the upper half. This process continues until the value is found or the interval is empty.\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a binary search on a sorted list to find the target element.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A sorted list of elements.\n        target: The element to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The index of the target element if found, -1 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2  # Calculate the middle index\n\n        # Check if the target is present at the middle\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        # If target is greater, ignore the left half\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        # If target is smaller, ignore the right half\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    # If the target is not found in the array\n    return -1\n\n# Example Usage:\nmy_list = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]\ntarget_element_found = 12\ntarget_element_not_found = 30\n\n# Search for an element that exists\nindex_found = binary_search(my_list, target_element_found)\nif index_found != -1:\n    print(f\"Element {target_element_found} found at index {index_found}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Element {target_element_found} not found in the list\")\n\n# Search for an element that does not exist\nindex_not_found = binary_search(my_list, target_element_not_found)\nif index_not_found != -1:\n    print(f\"Element {target_element_not_found} found at index {index_not_found}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Element {target_element_not_found} not found in the list\")\n\n```\n\n**Key Characteristics of Binary Search:**\n\n1.  **Sorted Data Requirement:** Binary search can only be applied to data that is already sorted (either in ascending or descending order).\n2.  **Time Complexity:** Its time complexity is O(log n), which makes it very efficient for large datasets compared to linear search (O(n)).\n3.  **Space Complexity:** Its space complexity is O(1) for iterative implementations (like the one above) and O(log n) for recursive implementations due to the call stack.\n\nThis algorithm is fundamental in computer science and is used in many applications where efficient searching is required.",

    "content": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It's a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its key characteristics:\n\n1.  **Base Case:** Every recursive function must have a \"base case,\" which is a condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error. The base case solves the simplest form of the problem directly, without further recursion.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step:** The \"recursive step\" is where the function calls itself with a modified input, moving closer to the base case. The problem is broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nImagine you want to calculate the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n*   **Non-recursive (iterative) way:** You would use a loop to multiply numbers from 1 up to 5.\n*   **Recursive way:**\n    *   The factorial of `n` is `n * factorial(n-1)`.\n    *   The base case is `factorial(0)` or `factorial(1)`, which is 1.\n\nSo, for `factorial(5)`:\n*   `factorial(5)` calls `5 * factorial(4)`\n*   `factorial(4)` calls `4 * factorial(3)`\n*   `factorial(3)` calls `3 * factorial(2)`\n*   `factorial(2)` calls `2 * factorial(1)`\n*   `factorial(1)` returns `1` (base case)\n\nThen the results propagate back up:\n*   `factorial(2)` becomes `2 * 1 = 2`\n*   `factorial(3)` becomes `3 * 2 = 6`\n*   `factorial(4)` becomes `4 * 6 = 24`\n*   `factorial(5)` becomes `5 * 24 = 120`\n\n**Advantages of Recursion:**\n\n*   **Elegance and Readability:** For certain problems (like tree traversals, quicksort, mergesort), recursive solutions can be much more concise and easier to understand than iterative ones, often directly mirroring the mathematical definition of the problem.\n*   **Solving Complex Problems:** It's often the most natural way to express solutions to problems that are inherently defined in terms of smaller, similar sub-problems (e.g., fractal generation, parsing languages).\n\n**Disadvantages of Recursion:**\n\n*   **Performance Overhead:** Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. This can lead to increased memory consumption and slower execution compared to iterative solutions, especially for deep recursions.\n*   **Stack Overflow:** If the recursion goes too deep without reaching a base case, it can exhaust the call stack memory, leading to a \"stack overflow\" error.\n*   **Debugging Difficulty:** Debugging recursive functions can be more challenging due to the way the call stack builds up and unwinds.\n\nRecursion is a powerful concept in computer science and is fundamental to understanding many algorithms and data structures.",

Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size declared at the time of creation, linked lists allocate memory for each node as needed. This makes them very efficient when the number of elements is not known beforehand or changes frequently.\n\n2.  **Efficient Insertions and Deletions:**\n    *   **Insertion:** To insert an element, you only need to update a few pointers (e.g., the `next` pointer of the preceding node and the `prev` pointer of the succeeding node in a doubly linked list). This operation takes constant time (O(1)) once the insertion point is found.\n    *   **Deletion:** Similarly, deleting an element involves updating a few pointers. Once the node to be deleted is located, the deletion also takes constant time (O(1)).\n    In contrast, inserting or deleting elements in an array can require shifting a large number of elements, which can take O(n) time in the worst case.\n\n3.  **No Memory Waste (or less):** Since memory is allocated dynamically for each node, there is no pre-allocation of a large block of memory that might go unused, as can happen with arrays if the maximum size is overestimated. This leads to more efficient memory utilization.\n\n4.  **Implementation of Other Data Structures:** Linked lists are fundamental for implementing many other complex data structures, such as:\n    *   Stacks (using a singly linked list where elements are added/removed from the head)\n    *   Queues (using a singly linked list where elements are added at the tail and removed from the head)\n    *   Graphs (using adjacency lists)\n    *   Hash tables (for collision resolution)\n\n5.  **Flexibility:** Different types of linked lists (singly, doubly, circular) offer flexibility in specific use cases. For instance, doubly linked lists allow traversal in both forward and backward directions, which can be beneficial for certain algorithms.\n\nWhile linked lists excel in dynamic size and efficient insertions/deletions, they do have drawbacks, such as slower access to elements (O(n) for random access) compared to arrays (O(1)), and higher memory overhead due to storing pointers. However, for scenarios where frequent modifications (insertions/deletions) are required and random access is less critical, linked lists are often the preferred choice.",

This means they don't require a large block of contiguous memory, which can be advantageous in systems with fragmented memory.\n\n5.  **Implementation of Other Data Structures:** Linked lists are fundamental for implementing many other abstract data types, such as stacks, queues, hash tables (using separate chaining for collision resolution), and graphs (using adjacency lists).\n\n**When to use a Linked List:**\n\n*   When the number of elements is unknown or fluctuates significantly.\n*   When frequent insertions or deletions are required in the middle of the data structure.\n*   When memory is fragmented or needs to be used efficiently without pre-allocating large blocks.\n\nWhile linked lists offer these advantages, it's also important to remember their disadvantages, such as slower access to elements (O(n) for random access) compared to arrays (O(1)), and higher memory overhead per element due to storing pointers.",

    "content": "Arrays are fundamental data structures used in programming to store collections of items. Here are some common and important uses of arrays:\n\n1.  **Storing Collections of Similar Data:** Arrays are ideal for holding multiple values of the same type. For example, a list of student names, a series of temperature readings, or a collection of product prices.\n\n2.  **Implementing Other Data Structures:** Many other complex data structures are built using arrays as their underlying foundation. Examples include:\n    *   **Stacks:** Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure, often implemented with an array where elements are added and removed from one end.\n    *   **Queues:** First-In, First-Out (FIFO) structure, often implemented with an array where elements are added at one end and removed from the other.\n    *   **Hash Tables (Hash Maps):** Use arrays to store key-value pairs, where the array index is determined by a hash function.\n    *   **Heaps:** Tree-based data structures often represented efficiently using arrays.\n    *   **Adjacency Lists for Graphs:** Representing connections in a graph where each element of an array points to a list of its neighbors.\n\n3.  **Organizing Tabular Data:** Arrays, particularly multi-dimensional arrays (like 2D arrays), are perfect for representing grids, matrices, or tables. For instance, a spreadsheet, an image (where each pixel is an element), or game boards (like chess or tic-tac-toe).\n\n4.  **Performing Mathematical Operations:** Arrays are extensively used in numerical computing, linear algebra, and scientific applications for operations like:\n    *   Matrix multiplication\n    *   Vector operations\n    *   Storing coefficients of polynomials\n\n5.  **Efficient Data Access:** Arrays provide O(1) (constant time) access to any element if its index is known. This makes them very efficient for lookup operations when you know the position of the data you want.\n\n6.  **Sorting and Searching:** Arrays are the primary data structure on which many sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) and searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search) operate.\n\n7.  **Buffering Data:** In I/O operations or data streaming, arrays are often used as buffers to temporarily hold data before it's processed or written to a destination.\n\n8.  **Managing Fixed-Size Collections:** When you know the exact number of items you need to store beforehand, an array is a good choice as it allocates a contiguous block of memory, which can be more memory-efficient than dynamic data structures in some scenarios.\n\nIn summary, arrays are versatile and fundamental, serving as the backbone for storing ordered collections of data, implementing more complex data structures, and enabling efficient data manipulation in a wide range of programming tasks.",

    "content": "A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element, often called a \"node,\" contains two parts:\n\n1.  **Data:** The actual value or information stored in the node.\n2.  **Pointer (or Reference):** A link to the next node in the sequence.\n\nThe first node in a linked list is called the **head**, and it is used to access the entire list. The last node in the list points to `NULL` (or `None` in some languages) to indicate the end of the list.\n\n**Key Characteristics of Linked Lists:**\n\n*   **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink in size during execution as needed, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.\n*   **Ease of Insertion/Deletion:** Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is relatively efficient, as it only requires updating a few pointers. In arrays, insertion/deletion can involve shifting many elements.\n*   **Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation:** Nodes are scattered in memory, and the links between them are established by pointers.\n*   **No Random Access:** To access an element at a specific position, you must traverse the list from the head, node by node. This means random access (like `array[index]`) is not directly supported.\n\n**Types of Linked Lists:**\n\n1.  **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node in the sequence. Traversal is only possible in one direction (forward).\n2.  **Doubly Linked List:** Each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node and one pointing to the previous node. This allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions.\n3.  **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node (head), forming a circle. This can be either singly or doubly linked.\n\n**Common Use Cases:**\n\n*   Implementing stacks and queues.\n*   Managing dynamic memory allocation (e.g., in operating systems).\n*   Representing polynomial expressions.\n*   Implementing hash tables (using separate chaining for collision resolution).\n*   Creating undo/redo functionalities in applications.",

This includes hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling.\n\nSystem calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system. They are the only way for user programs to access the resources provided by the operating system, such as:\n\n*   **File Management:** Operations like creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files. Examples include `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`.\n*   **Process Control:** Creating new processes, terminating processes, loading programs, and managing process attributes. Examples include `fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()`, `wait()`.\n*   **Device Management:** Requesting, releasing, reading from, and writing to devices.\n*   **Information Maintenance:** Getting system time, date, process ID, or setting system data. Examples include `getpid()`, `time()`.\n*   **Communication:** Interprocess communication (IPC) through mechanisms like pipes, shared memory, or message passing. Examples include `pipe()`, `shmget()`, `msgget()`.\n\nWhen a program makes a system call, it typically involves a context switch from user mode to kernel mode. In user mode, a program has limited access to system resources, while in kernel mode, it has full access. The operating system kernel then performs the requested service on behalf of the program and returns control (and often a result) back to the program in user mode.\n\nSystem calls are usually not called directly by application programmers. Instead, they are typically accessed through a high-level Application Programming Interface (API), such as the POSIX API for Unix-like systems or the Windows API for Windows systems. These APIs provide library functions (like `printf()`, `malloc()`, `fopen()`) that, in turn, make the necessary system calls. This abstraction simplifies programming and makes applications more portable.",

System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system. They are the only way for a program to access hardware resources or other operating system services.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what that means:\n\n1.  **Kernel Interaction:** The kernel is the core of an operating system. It manages the system's resources (CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.) and provides fundamental services. User programs cannot directly access these resources or perform privileged operations.\n2.  **Requesting Services:** When a program needs to do something that requires kernel-level privileges or resources (like reading from a file, writing to the screen, creating a new process, allocating memory, or sending data over a network), it makes a system call.\n3.  **Interface:** System calls define a well-defined interface or API (Application Programming Interface) that application programs can use to interact with the operating system.\n4.  **Mode Switch:** When a program makes a system call, the CPU switches from \"user mode\" (where applications run with limited privileges) to \"kernel mode\" (where the operating system kernel runs with full privileges). This mode switch is crucial for security and system stability, as it prevents user programs from directly corrupting or misusing system resources.\n5.  **Examples:**\n    *   `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()` for file operations.\n    *   `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()` for process management.\n    *   `socket()`, `connect()`, `send()`, `recv()` for network communication.\n    *   `malloc()` (though often a library function, it internally uses system calls like `brk()` or `mmap()` for memory allocation).\n\nIn essence, system calls are the gatekeepers that allow user applications to safely and securely interact with the underlying hardware and the operating system's core functionalities.",

    "content": "A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n*   **Purpose:** Functions are designed to encapsulate a specific task or a set of operations. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can define it once within a function and then call that function whenever you need to perform that task.\n*   **Input (Parameters/Arguments):** Functions can accept input values, known as parameters or arguments. These inputs allow the function to operate on different data each time it's called, making it more flexible and reusable.\n*   **Output (Return Value):** A function can produce an output value, which is returned to the part of the code that called the function. This output is often the result of the operations performed inside the function.\n*   **Reusability:** Once a function is defined, it can be called multiple times from different parts of your program, reducing redundancy and making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n*   **Modularity:** Functions help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Each function can focus on a specific sub-problem, making the overall program easier to understand, debug, and test.\n*   **Abstraction:** When you call a function, you don't necessarily need to know *how* it performs its task, only *what* it does and what inputs it expects. This level of abstraction simplifies the use of complex operations.\n\n**Example in a programming context (e.g., Python):**\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function greets the person passed in as an argument.\n  \"\"\"\n  return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"\n\n# Calling the function\nmessage1 = greet(\"Alice\")\nprint(message1) # Output: Hello, Alice!\n\nmessage2 = greet(\"Bob\")\nprint(message2) # Output: Hello, Bob!\n```\n\nIn this example:\n*   `greet` is the function name.\n*   `name` is a parameter.\n*   The string `\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"` is the return value.\n\nFunctions are a fundamental concept in almost all programming languages and are essential for writing efficient, organized, and maintainable code.",

    "content": "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It's often used for problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. A recursive function must have a base case (a condition under which the function stops calling itself) to prevent infinite loops.\n\nHere's an example program in Python that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion.\n    Factorial of n (n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n    0! is defined as 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumber = 5\nresult = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}\")\n\nnumber = 0\nresult = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}\")\n\nnumber = 7\nresult = factorial(number)\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {result}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`factorial(n)` function:**\n    *   **Base Case (`if n == 0 or n == 1:`):** This is the crucial part that stops the recursion. The factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of 1 is also 1. When `n` reaches one of these values, the function returns directly without making further recursive calls.\n    *   **Recursive Case (`else: return n * factorial(n - 1)`):** For any `n` greater than 1, the function calculates `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`. It calls itself (`factorial(n - 1)`) with a smaller argument, moving closer to the base case.\n\n**How it works for `factorial(5)`:**\n\n1.  `factorial(5)` calls `5 * factorial(4)`\n2.  `factorial(4)` calls `4 * factorial(3)`\n3.  `factorial(3)` calls `3 * factorial(2)`\n4.  `factorial(2)` calls `2 * factorial(1)`\n5.  `factorial(1)` hits the base case and returns `1`.\n6.  `factorial(2)` receives `1` and returns `2 * 1 = 2`.\n7.  `factorial(3)` receives `2` and returns `3 * 2 = 6`.\n8.  `factorial(4)` receives `6` and returns `4 * 6 = 24`.\n9.  `factorial(5)` receives `24` and returns `5 * 24 = 120`.\n\nThis example clearly demonstrates the two essential components of a recursive function: a base case and a recursive step.",

It works by sorting numbers digit by digit from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD), or vice versa. The key idea is to use a stable sorting algorithm (like Counting Sort) as a subroutine for each digit.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n**How Radix Sort Works:**\n\n1.  **Determine the Maximum Number of Digits (or Max Value):** Find the number with the maximum number of digits in the input array. This determines how many passes the sorting algorithm will make.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Digits:**\n    *   Start with the least significant digit (LSD).\n    *   For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.), perform a stable sort (typically Counting Sort) on the input array based on the value of that specific digit.\n    *   After sorting by one digit, the array is partially sorted.\n    *   Move to the next significant digit and repeat the process.\n\n3.  **Counting Sort as a Subroutine:**\n    *   Counting Sort is ideal for Radix Sort because it is stable (maintains the relative order of elements with equal values) and efficient for a limited range of integer keys.\n    *   For each pass (i.e., for each digit position `exp`):\n        *   Create a `count` array of size 10 (for digits 0-9) initialized to zeros.\n        *   Iterate through the input array and count the occurrences of each digit at the current `exp` position. For example, if `exp` is 10 (for tens place), for the number 123, the digit at this position is `(123 / 10) % 10 = 2`.\n        *   Modify the `count` array to store the actual position of each digit in the output array. This is done by adding the previous counts: `count[i] = count[i] + count[i-1]`.\n        *   Create an `output` array of the same size as the input array.\n        *   Iterate through the input array *from right to left* (to maintain stability) and place elements into the `output` array based on their digit's count and decrement the count.\n        *   Copy the elements from the `output` array back to the original input array.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nLet's sort the array `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]` using Radix Sort.\n\n*   **Max digits:** 3 (from 170, 802)\n\n**Pass 1: Sort by Units Digit (exp = 1)**\n\n*   Digits:\n    *   170 -> 0\n    *   45 -> 5\n    *   75 -> 5\n    *   90 -> 0\n    *   802 -> 2\n    *   24 -> 4\n    *   2 -> 2\n    *   66 -> 6\n\n*   Applying Counting Sort based on units digit:\n    *   Initial Array: `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`\n    *   Sorted by units digit: `[170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]` (Notice 2 comes before 802, and 45 before 75 due to stability)\n\n**Pass 2: Sort by Tens Digit (exp = 10)**\n\n*   Digits:\n    *   170 -> 7\n    *   90 -> 9\n    *   802 -> 0\n    *   2 -> 0\n    *   24 -> 2\n    *   45 -> 4\n    *   75 -> 7\n    *   66 -> 6\n\n*   ",

    "content": "Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits which share the same significant position and value. It can be applied to data that can be sorted by creating a series of individual \"digits\" or \"components\".\n\nHere's a breakdown of how Radix Sort works, typically using the Least Significant Digit (LSD) approach:\n\n**Core Idea:**\nRadix sort works by processing digits from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD) or vice-versa. For each digit, it uses a stable sorting algorithm (like Counting Sort) to sort the numbers based on that digit.\n\n**Steps (LSD Radix Sort):**\n\n1.  **Find the Maximum Number:** Determine the largest number in the array to know the maximum number of digits any number has. This tells us how many passes we need to make.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Digits:** Perform a stable sort for each digit place, starting from the least significant digit (units place), then tens, hundreds, and so on, up to the most significant digit.\n\n    *   **Units Place (1s):** Sort all numbers based on their units digit. For example, if you have [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66], after sorting by units digit (using a stable sort like Counting Sort), it might look something like [170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66] (the relative order of 170 and 90, or 802 and 2, remains because they have the same units digit and the sort is stable).\n\n    *   **Tens Place (10s):** Now, take the partially sorted array and sort it based on the tens digit. Again, maintain stability. From the example above, if we sort [170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66] by the tens digit, it might become [2, 802, 24, 45, 66, 75, 170, 90].\n\n    *   **Hundreds Place (100s):** Repeat for the hundreds digit. Taking [2, 802, 24, 45, 66, 75, 170, 90] and sorting by hundreds digit: [2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802].\n\n3.  **Result:** After iterating through all significant digit places, the array will be fully sorted.\n\n**Why Counting Sort is often used as a subroutine:**\n\nCounting Sort is ideal for Radix Sort because it is a stable sorting algorithm. Stability means that if two numbers have the same value for the current digit being sorted, their relative order in the input array is preserved in the output array. This is crucial for Radix Sort to work correctly, as the previous sorts (on less significant digits) must not be undone by the current sort.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nLet's sort `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`\n\n*   **Max Digits:** Max number is 802 (3 digits). We need 3 passes.\n\n*   **Pass 1 (Units Digit):**\n    *   Original: `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`\n    *   Digits: `[0, 5, 5, 0, 2, 4, 2, 6]`\n    *   Sorted by units (stable sort): `",

However, it has some advantages:\n\n1.  **Simple Implementation:** It's one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement.\n2.  **Efficient for Small Data Sets:** It is efficient for small data sets or partially sorted data sets.\n3.  **Adaptive:** It is adaptive, meaning it performs well for data that is already substantially sorted. The time complexity is O(n+k) where k is the number of inversions.\n4.  **Stable:** It is a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal key values is maintained.\n5.  **In-place:** It sorts the array in-place, meaning it doesn't require extra space proportional to the input size.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThe array is conceptually divided into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part contains only the first element of the array, and the rest of the array is unsorted.\n\nThe algorithm iterates through the unsorted part, taking one element at a time and inserting it into its correct position within the sorted part. This insertion is done by comparing the current element with elements in the sorted part, moving larger elements one position to the right to make space for the current element.\n\n**Step-by-step example:**\n\nLet's sort the array `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6]` using Insertion Sort.\n\n1.  **Initial Array:** `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6]`\n    *   Sorted part: `[12]`\n    *   Unsorted part: `[11, 13, 5, 6]`\n\n2.  **Iteration 1 (Element to insert: 11):**\n    *   Compare `11` with `12`. Since `11 < 12`, move `12` one position to the right.\n    *   Insert `11` before `12`.\n    *   Array: `[11, 12, 13, 5, 6]`\n    *   Sorted part: `[11, 12]`\n    *   Unsorted part: `[13, 5, 6]`\n\n3.  **Iteration 2 (Element to insert: 13):**\n    *   Compare `13` with `12`. Since `13 > 12`, `13` is already in its correct position relative to `12`.\n    *   Array: `[11, 12, 13, 5, 6]`\n    *   Sorted part: `[11, 12, 13]`\n    *   Unsorted part: `[5, 6]`\n\n4.  **Iteration 3 (Element to insert: 5):**\n    *   Compare `5` with `13`. Since `5 < 13`, move `13` to the right. Array: `[11, 12, 13, 13, 6]`\n    *   Compare `5` with `12`. Since `5 < 12`, move `12` to the right. Array: `[11, 12, 12, 13, 6]`\n    *   Compare `5` with `11`. Since `5 < 11`, move `11` to the right. Array: `[11, 11, 12, 13, 6]`\n    *   Insert `5` at the beginning.\n    *   Array: `[5, 11, 12, 13, 6]`\n    ",

It's often used for sorting numbers or strings, especially when the range of key values is large.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of Radix Sort along with an explanation:\n\n```python\ndef counting_sort_by_digit(arr, exp):\n    \"\"\"\n    A stable sort (counting sort) that sorts the input array 'arr'\n    based on the digit represented by 'exp' (e.g., 1 for units place,\n    10 for tens place, 100 for hundreds place, etc.).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    output = [0] * n\n    count = [0] * 10  # For digits 0-9\n\n    # Store count of occurrences in count[]\n    for i in range(n):\n        index = (arr[i] // exp) % 10\n        count[index] += 1\n\n    # Change count[i] so that count[i] now contains actual\n    # position of this digit in output[]\n    for i in range(1, 10):\n        count[i] += count[i - 1]\n\n    # Build the output array\n    # Iterate from the end to maintain stability\n    i = n - 1\n    while i >= 0:\n        index = (arr[i] // exp) % 10\n        output[count[index] - 1] = arr[i]\n        count[index] -= 1\n        i -= 1\n\n    # Copy the output array to arr[], so that arr[] now\n    # contains sorted numbers according to current digit\n    for i in range(n):\n        arr[i] = output[i]\n\ndef radix_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements Radix Sort to sort the input array 'arr'.\n    Assumes all numbers are non-negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not arr:\n        return\n\n    # Find the maximum number to know number of digits\n    max_val = max(arr)\n\n    # Do counting sort for every digit. Note that instead\n    # of passing digit number, exp is passed. exp is 10^i\n    # where i is current digit number\n    exp = 1\n    while max_val // exp > 0:\n        counting_sort_by_digit(arr, exp)\n        exp *= 10\n\n# Example Usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_list = [170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]\n    print(\"Original list:\", my_list)\n    radix_sort(my_list)\n    print(\"Sorted list (Radix Sort):\", my_list)\n\n    my_list_2 = [329, 457, 657, 839, 436, 720, 355]\n    print(\"Original list 2:\", my_list_2)\n    radix_sort(my_list_2)\n    print(\"Sorted list 2 (Radix Sort):\", my_list_2)\n\n    my_list_3 = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3, 9, 4, 7, 6, 0]\n    print(\"Original list 3:\", my_list_3)\n    radix_sort(my_list_3)\n    print(\"Sorted list 3 (Radix Sort):\", my_list_3)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Radix Sort:\n\n1.  **Core Idea:** Radix sort works by processing digits from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD) or vice-versa. The most common approach, and the one implemented above, is LSD Radix Sort.\n\n2.  **`radix_",
